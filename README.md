## Why am I doing this?

I have a lot of cards in my collection, but I don't really know what my collection has. When I'm building a deck, I buy singles and sometimes I may already own that card, but I may realise it because I don't keep track of what I have very well. Therefore, I end up buying cards that I already have.

Also, this is a really good excuse to learn technologies that I am not familiar with.
